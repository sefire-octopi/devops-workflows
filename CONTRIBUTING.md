### 1. Fork the Repository

Head over to the [Parent Repo](https://github.com/defire-octopi/devops-workflows) on GitHub and click the magical "Fork" button to create your own copy of the repository.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Bring your forked repository to life on your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/devops-workflows.git
cd devops-workflows
```

### 3. Create a Branch

Branches are your best friends. Create a new one for your feature or bug fix:

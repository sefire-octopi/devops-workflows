# üåü Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct üåü

## Our Pledge

Hey there, awesome contributor! üéâ We're thrilled to have you here. Our mission is to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. As community members, contributors, and leaders, we pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of who you are or where you come from. We promise to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

To keep things friendly and professional, here‚Äôs a quick guide on how to be an amazing community member:

### Be Cool üòé

- Show empathy and kindness towards others.
- Respect different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.
- Take responsibility and apologize when needed, then move forward.
- Focus on what‚Äôs best for the community.

### Not Cool üëé

- Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwelcome sexual advances.
- Trolling, insulting, or making derogatory comments.
- Harassing others, whether in public or private.
- Sharing private information without permission.
- Engaging in other behavior that could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Responsibilities of Community Leaders

Our community leaders are here to keep things running smoothly. They‚Äôre responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. Leaders will take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that don‚Äôt align with this Code of Conduct. They‚Äôll also communicate reasons for their decisions when necessary.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

If you see or experience any unacceptable behavior, don‚Äôt hesitate to report it! Reach out to our community leaders at [origin@sefire.org]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

To keep things fair and transparent, here‚Äôs how we handle misconduct:

### 1. Chill Out üòá

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, including an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate and a request for a public or private apology if necessary.

### 2. Cool Down ü•∂

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. The person will have to refrain from interacting with the people involved, including unsolicited interactions with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Take a Break ‚è∏Ô∏è

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this time. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Timeout üõë

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or aggression.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
